# read-me-generator

This application will prompt the user with a series of questions in the command line and create a readme.md
file based on the users input. The readme will include the project title sections entitled Description, Table
of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions. When the user includes their 
GitHub name, GitHub link, and email they are placed in the section titled "Questions". The user also can choose 
their application's license and status from a list.
